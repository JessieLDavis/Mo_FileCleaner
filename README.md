# Mo_FileCleaner

A small program that quickly finds files within a nest of folders. It automatically moves the files to new specified folders. It does not move between harddrives at this time.

Please note that the audio files included in the test example are from Kevin Macleaod. His website has some great Public Domain music so please check him out!
